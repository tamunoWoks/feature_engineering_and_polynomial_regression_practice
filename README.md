# Feature Engineering and Polynomial Regression
### Overview
This Jupyter Notebook explores feature engineering and its role in improving machine learning models, specifically focusing on polynomial regression. Feature engineering helps enhance model performance by transforming raw data into more meaningful representations. Polynomial regression extends linear models by incorporating higher-order terms, capturing complex relationships between variables.
